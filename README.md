# yPhone - Mindful Phone Usage App

A mindful Android app that encourages conscious phone usage by asking a simple question every time
you unlock your device.

## What it does

When you unlock your phone, yPhone automatically launches and asks:

**"Why did you open your phone?"**

You have two choices:

- **"For a reason"** - The app wishes you good luck and closes
- **"For no reason"** - The app suggests you put your phone down and do something meaningful instead

## Features

- **Automatic launch** - Opens every time you unlock your phone
- **Mindful reflection** - Encourages you to think before using your phone
- **Simple choices** - Just two options to choose from
- **Smart timing** - Won't spam you (minimum 1 minute between prompts)
- **Beautiful UI** - Modern Material Design interface
- **Auto-close** - Closes automatically after 5 seconds

## How it works

1. **Screen Unlock Detection**: Uses Android's `USER_PRESENT` broadcast to detect when the device is
   unlocked
2. **Mindful Prompt**: Shows a simple question with two answer choices
3. **Thoughtful Response**: Provides appropriate feedback based on your choice
4. **Smart Cooldown**: Prevents spam by waiting at least 1 minute between prompts
